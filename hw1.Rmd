## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Question 1:
Define supervised and unsupervised learning. What are the difference(s) between them?

In supervised learning, input data is provided to the model along with the output. 
In unsupervised learning, only input data is provided to the model.

Question 2:
Explain the difference between a regression model and a classification model, specifically in the context of machine learning.

Regression helps predict a continuous quantity (Y is quantitative), 
classification predicts discrete class labels, Categorical values (Y is qualitative)


Question 3:
Name two commonly used metrics for regression ML problems. Name two commonly used metrics for classification ML problems.

Regression model: Mean Squared Error (MSE). Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
classification model :confusion matrix, log-loss


Question 4:
As discussed, statistical models can be used for different purposes. These purposes can generally be classified into the following three categories. Provide a brief description of each.    

Descriptive models:Choose model to best visually emphasize a trend in data i.e., using a line on a scatterplot

Inferential models:Aim is to test theories (Possibly) causal claims State relationship between outcome & predictor(s)

Predictive models:Aim is to predict Y with minimum reducible error Not focused on hypothesis tests 
(Lecture note day2)

Question 5:
Predictive models are frequently used in machine learning, and they can usually be described as either mechanistic or empirically-driven. Answer the following questions.

Define mechanistic. Define empirically-driven. How do these model types differ? How are they similar?

In general, is a mechanistic or empirically-driven model easier to understand? Explain your choice.

Describe how the bias-variance tradeoff is related to the use of mechanistic or empirically-driven models.



Question 6:
A political candidate’s campaign has collected some detailed voter history data from their constituents. The campaign is interested in two questions:

Given a voter’s profile/data, how likely is it that they will vote in favor of the candidate?

How would a voter’s likelihood of support for the candidate change if they had personal contact with the candidate?

Classify each question as either predictive or inferential. Explain your reasoning for each.



Exercise 1:
We are interested in highway miles per gallon, or the hwy variable. Create a histogram of this variable. Describe what you see/learn.

```{r}

```

Exercise 2:
Create a scatterplot. Put hwy on the x-axis and cty on the y-axis. Describe what you notice. Is there a relationship between hwy and cty? What does this mean?

```{r}

```

Exercise 3:
Make a bar plot of manufacturer. Flip it so that the manufacturers are on the y-axis. Order the bars by height. Which manufacturer produced the most cars? Which produced the least?


```{r}

```

Exercise 4:
Make a box plot of hwy, grouped by cyl. Do you see a pattern? If so, what?

```{r}

```

Exercise 5:
Use the corrplot package to make a lower triangle correlation matrix of the mpg dataset. (Hint: You can find information on the package here.)
Which variables are positively or negatively correlated with which others? Do these relationships make sense to you? Are there any that surprise you?

```{r}

```


#### Exercise 6: 
   Recreate the following graphic, as closely as you can. *Hint: Use the `ggthemes` package.* 
   ```{r, echo=FALSE} 
 mpg %>% 
 ggplot() + 
 geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy)) + 
 geom_jitter(mapping = aes(x = class, y = hwy),  
 alpha = .25,  
 height = 0) + 
 theme_gdocs() + 
 labs(x = "Vehicle Class", y = "Highway MPG") + 
 coord_flip() 
 ``` 
   #### Exercise 7 
   Recreate the following graphic. 
   ```{r, echo=FALSE} 
 mpg %>% 
 ggplot() +  
 geom_boxplot(mapping=aes(x = class, y = hwy, fill = drv)) 
 ``` 
   #### Exercise 8 
   Recreate the following graphic. 
   ```{r, echo=FALSE} 
 mpg %>% 
 ggplot(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) +  
 geom_point(aes(color = drv)) + 
 geom_smooth(aes(linetype = drv), se = FALSE) 
 ```
